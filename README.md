# Ising Model
The 2D Ising model is a mathematical model in statisical mechanics of a two dimensional spin lattice.
A spin state is a state that can take one of two values, typically denoted up and down.
The Ising model couples neighboring spins in the lattice by imposing the Hamiltonian
$$H = J \Sigma_{<i, j>} \sigma_i \sigma_j$$
where $J \in \$
